# Medical Chatbot 

A sophisticated medical consultation chatbot developed using cutting-edge technologies, including LangChain, LLM, Ollama, OpenAI API, and Streamlit. This chatbot offers medical consultations and delivers general health precautions. It leverages an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for efficient handling of complex patient histories, EMR (Electronic Medical Record) data, and graphical or diagrammatic inputs.

# Technology Stack

1. LangChain: For chaining and orchestrating the LLM workflows.
2. LLM: Large Language Model for natural language understanding and generation.
3. Ollama: For efficient language processing and interaction.
4. OpenAI API: Powering the chatbotâ€™s responses with state-of-the-art models.
5. Streamlit: For building a responsive and interactive front-end interface.

# How It Works

1. User Query: Users input their medical questions, patient histories, or upload graphical data.
2. Data Processing:
      The RAG pipeline retrieves and processes relevant information from medical datasets.
      EMR data and images are analyzed to provide contextual responses.
3. Response Generation: The chatbot formulates detailed medical advice or health precautions using OpenAI API and LLM.
4. Interactive Results: Users receive real-time, tailored medical insights via the Streamlit interface.
